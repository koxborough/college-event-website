# College Event Website

Hi! I'm Khalil Oxborough, and at the time of making this project I am a junior at the University of Central Florida studying Computer Science. I hope you enjoy!

## Report

The report for the project can be found as the path: <code>docs/report.pdf</code>. It contains my full writeup of the assignment and its requirements, include a table of contents, project description, relational model of the database, etc.

## Database Initialization

The entirety of the database commands I used to create the database can be found as the path: <code>docs/college-event-website.sql</code>. Running this will build the entire database, including tables, constraints, and stored procedures. <strong>It does not contain data.</strong>
